A not-good CLI for search YouTube (officially)


You're gonna need mpv and a YouTube v3 Data API key in addition to the pipfile requirements (nothing big outside of the damn Google library).

The only reason this exists is because YouTube seems to have killed unofficial (non-API key'd) playlist searching with libraries like pafy, et. al. I use the amazing `yewtube` player but can no longer do pl searches with it, so I wrote this piece of working crap to both do that and experiement with Rich, prompt-toolkit, and CUI in general.
